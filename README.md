Register a user, create a league and then start drafting;

The draft will begin when the Maximum amount of users are currently in the same drafting page, 

For multiple users to be in the same drafting page, first create multiple accounts and have them go to the Join League button in their homepage. From there, create a team via a Team Name, once you are successful, you will be redirected to the homepage, and the team you created will now appear in your teams page. Click on the "Go to Draft" button and you will then be added to the draft. Repeat this until this the maximum ammount of players.

You can now start your draft, click on players you want to draft, turns are enabled.
